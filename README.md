<b>CTF_Python_Challenge</b>

An unknown plaintext message was given as input to the encryption program (encryptor.py), which prints the output of the ciphertext message '2e84cb5f6c34b0a38fcdf99749' (ciphertext.txt). The goal is to provide the plaintext of the uncrypted message with having encryptor.py and ciphertext.

My solution program with comments of my way of approach, which prints the output of the uncrypted message, is under decryptor.py. The file is protected with uncrypted ciphertext. If you want to view the solution code, please contact me personally via email for password.

About:
I got the idea for this encryption program from the CTF challenges in the CyWar platform (https://cywar.hackeru.com/), where access is granted to participants of HackerU RedTeam cybersecurity courses. This challenge was marked as the highest difficulty from all Python-related challenges and requires analyzing, understanding Python code, and reverse engineering for a solution.
