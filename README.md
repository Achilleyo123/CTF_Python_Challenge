<b>CTF_Python_Challenge</b>

An unknown plaintext message was given as input to the encryption program (encryptor.py), which as the output prints ciphertext message '2e84cb5f6c34b0a38fcdf99749' (ciphertext.txt). The goal is to provide the plaintext message before it was encrypted having only encryptor.py and ciphertext.

My solution code with comments on my approach is in a password-protected .7z file (decryptor.7z). The file is protected with a solved unencrypted message. If you want to view the solution code, don't hesitate to contact me personally.

About:
I got the idea for this encryption program from the CTF challenges in the CyWar platform (https://cywar.hackeru.com/), where access is granted to participants of HackerU RedTeam cybersecurity courses. This challenge was marked as the most serious difficulty of all Python-related challenges and requires analyzing, understanding Python code, and reverse engineering for a solution.
